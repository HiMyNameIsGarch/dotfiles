# Problem: I have a single folder with all my screenshots, and it gets bigger
# Solve: Create a script that will create a folder for one week of screenshots
# Example: 23-April-2022 ( will contain screenshots from prev folder date and the current folder date )
# Combine this script with cronjobs to automate it
# Example cron job: @weekly ~/.local/bin/folderize-ss
