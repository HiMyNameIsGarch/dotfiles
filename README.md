# Garch's dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles for my linux system.

 - Useful scripts found in `~/.local/bin/`
 - Settings for: 
    - vim / nvim (text editor)
    - zsh / bash (shell)
    - alacritty (terminal)
    - dunst (notification daemon)
    - qutebrowser (browser)
    - picom (compositor)
 - In order to keep `~` cleaner I moved all posible configs under `~/.config`
 - enviroment variables are set in `~/.config/profile`
 - aliases are set in `~/.config/aliasrc`
## Usage
 - Window manager: 
    - Dwm
 - Application launcher:
    - Dmenu
 - Terminal:
    - Alacritty
 - Browser:
    - QuteBrowser / LibreWolf
